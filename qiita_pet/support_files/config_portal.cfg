  Qiita (<i>canonically pronounced cheetah</i>) is an entirely
  <strong>open-source</strong> microbial study management platform. It allows
  users to keep track of multiple studies with multiple ‘omics data.
  Additionally, Qiita is capable of supporting multiple analytical pipelines
  through a 3rd-party plugin system, allowing the user to have a single entry
  point for all of their analyses.
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
  Qiita provides database and compute resources to the global community,
  alleviating the technical burdens that are typically limiting for
  researchers studying microbial ecology (e.g. familiarity with the command
  line or access to compute power).
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
  Qiita’s platform allows for quick reanalysis of the datasets that have been
  deposited using the latest analytical technologies. This means that Qiita’s
  internal datasets are living data that is periodically re-annotated
  according to current best practices.
