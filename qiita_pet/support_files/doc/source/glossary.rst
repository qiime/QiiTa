Beginner Concepts 
=================

* **16S rRNA gene**
 * The 16s rRNA gene is a sequence of nucleotides present only in prokaryotic DNA. It codes for the protein structure of the 30th subunit in prokaryotic ribosomes. Its sequence remains relatively the same across all bacteria, because it has been highly conserved throughout evolutionary history. However, in microbiome research, we use the hypervariable V4 region of the gene as an identification marker for classifying bacteria. Genetically identifying organisms with techniques like 16s rRNA sequencing has only developed in the last twenty years and has begun to redefine the classification system of evolutionary identity for organisms like bacteria.

* **Amplicon**
 * An amplicon is a DNA sequence produced from natural or artificial replication and can be used to identify individuals genetically. Amplification sequencing methods like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next-generation sequencing (also referred to as next-gen sequencing) help microbiome researchers profile microbial communities in cost-effective and time-efficient ways.

* **Bacteroidetes**
 * Bacteroidetes is a phylum of Gram-negative bacteria that includes B. fragilis and Flavobacteria. They thrive in a wide variety of places like soil, sediment, and seawater, making them well-suited for the ecosystems present in the human gut. They specialize in breaking down organic matter like proteins and carbohydrates and are able to “gain energy from otherwise refractory carbohydrate sources”(1). Microbiome research is only just beginning to understand the metabolic and ecologic impact of Bacteroidetes in the human microbiome.

* **Firmicutes**
 * Firmicutes is a phylum of bacteria that includes species like Staphylococcus and Lactobacillus. In general, Firmicutes have Gram-positive cell walls, round cell shapes, and low guanine to cytosine content in their DNA. While some produce endospores to survive in extreme conditions, others reproduce through binary fission. They also have a wide variety of aerotolerance: some Firmicutes thrive in anaerobic environments, some in aerobic, and some in either. In microbiome research for example, higher proportions of Firmicutes in the intestinal human microbiome may be correlated with obesity (1).

* **Gammaproteobacteria**
 * Gammaproteobacteria is one of the four classes of the phylum of Gram-negative proteobacteria. The phylum has a wide range of characteristics, from bacillus to cocci shaped, from chemoautotrophic to photoautotrophic, from aerobic to anaerobic, and from pathogenic to symbiotic relationships. “One feature alone, 16s rRNA sequence relationship, has been used to define the class”(1). Salmonella and E.coli are both gammaproteobacteria.

* **Marker gene sequencing** 
 * Marker gene sequencing, also known as amplicon sequencing, is a technique that identifies a bacterial organism by its marker gene DNA sequence. In microbiome research, scientists use next-generation sequencing tools to amplify a sequence like the 16s rRNA gene, which is then used to infer the phenotypic makeup of that organism.

* **Phylogeny**
 * Phylogeny is the study of the evolutionary histories of organisms. Phylogeny analyzes the genotypic and phenotypic characteristics to identify individuals and uses phylogenetic trees to visualize these relationships. Speciation, or where two groups of individuals developed differently into two new species, is represented by a branching stems on the diagram.

* **Proteobacteria**
 * Proteobacteria is a phylum of Gram-negative bacteria that share similar nucleotide sequences in their genomes. The phylum is divided into five classes, each with their own distinct capabilities from intracellular pathogens, to nitrogen-converters and sulfate reducers, to scavengers. Helicobacter, Campylobacter, E.coli, and Bordetella pertussis are all proteobacteria.

* **Taxonomy**
 * Taxonomy is a classification system for understanding how organisms are related to each other. Scientists use phylogenetic trees as one form of visualizing taxonomy. A phylogenetic tree takes organisms grouped by phenotypic (physical) and genotypic (genetic) similarities and connects them to their common ancestor from which they diverged evolutionarily. In microbiome research, we have developed tools like Unifrac to measure the evolutionary distance of relatedness of the organisms in two different samples.

* **Taxonomic Rank** 
 * Taxonomic rank is a way of grouping organisms together based on their phenotypic and genotypic similarities. This ranking system originally proposed by Carl Linnaeus consists of seven levels: Domain, Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Genus, Species. Humans, for examples, are described as Eukarya, Animalia, Chordata, Mammalia, Primate, Hominidae, Homo, H. sapiens. In microbiome research, we use sequencing techniques like amplicon sequencing which amplifies the 16s rRNA gene in bacteria to identify and classify microbes into their taxonomic ranks.
