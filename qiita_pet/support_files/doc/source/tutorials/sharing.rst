Study and analysis sharing
==========================

.. note::
   You can only share studies and analysis with registered users via their
   email.

Qiita allows users to share their own Studies (owner, the User that created the
study) and Analysis with the goal of encourage online collaboration. When a
study or analysis  are shared the invited User inherits the same rights and
permissions that the owner of the Study has. These permissions are:

- Add, download and process any Qiita artifact. Most recently, this also
  includes the ability to download the raw sequence data added to each of the
  preparations. This feature is turned off for any public datasets for
  security reasons.
- Create, modify and delete the sample information. file
- Create, modify and delete any preparation information file

In the “Your Studies” section of the Studies List
you have a “Shared With These Users” column that lists all User names that
your study is shared with. You can click on the “Modify” button and add/remove
users. See below.
