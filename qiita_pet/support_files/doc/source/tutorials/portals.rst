User Portals
============

User portals allow a user to cordon off specific studies and analyses into their own user interface, which we call a portal, selectively slicing the data available through that portal.

The main `QIITA` portal gives access to all studies in the database, while adding studies to a specific portal and changing the config file to point to the portal will show the same interface, but with only the selected studies. To change the portal being accessed, simply change the `portal` setting in the qiita config file. This must correspond to a portal name in the database.

Creating/Deleting a portal
--------------------------
Portals are created using the command line interface. A portal may be added using the command ``qiita-env create-portal --portal [PORTAL NAME] --desc [PORTAL DESCRIPTION]``. Conversely, a portal may be deleted by the command ``qiita-env remove-portal --portal [PORTAL NAME]``. Note, however, that you can not remove a portal that has one or more studies/analyses attached to it. The portal must be completely connectionless to be deleted.

Adding/Deleting studies on a portal
-----------------------------------
Studies will automatically be added to the main `QIITA` portal, as well as the portal set in the config file if different than `QIITA`. To add or remove a study from a portal, there are two methods: Command line and web interface.

Command line additions and deletions can be done using the ``qiita db portal [add/remove]-studies --portal [PORTAL] --studies [LIST]``. The [PORTAL] is the name of the portal to add or remove from, and the [LIST] is a comma separated list of study IDs to act on. For example, to add studies 5 and 6 to the portal "EMP", you would use the following command: 

``qiita db portal add-studies --portal EMP --studies 5,6``

To add from the web interface, you must have admin privileges and be on the `QIITA` portal. You can then access the portals editing page through the admin menu dropdown. On this page, you can select all studies required, followed by the portal, and then add or remove as needed.

Adding/Deleting analyses on a portal
------------------------------------
Analyses will automatically be added to the main `QIITA` portal, as well as the portal set in the config file if different than `QIITA`. Because the analyses are heavily dependent on what studies and data are available, ***WE STRONGLY ADVISE NOT CHANGING THE PORTAL ASSIGNMENTS FOR ANALYSES.***

If absolutely required, command line additions and deletions can be done using the ``qiita db portal [add/remove]-analyses --portal [PORTAL] --analyses [LIST]``. The [PORTAL] is the name of the portal to add or remove from, and the [LIST] is a comma separated list of analysis IDs to act on. For example, to remove analyses 5 and 6 to the portal "EMP", you would use the following command:

``qiita db portal remove-analyses --portal EMP --analyses 5,6``

Customizing portal text and style
---------------------------------
Portals can have their own custom welcome text and css styling. Portals have their own configuration file, an example of which is in qiita_pet/support_files/portal_config.cfg

In this file, you can enter the title and logo for the portal, along with header and welcome text displayed on the index page. You may also add a filepath to a custom CSS file for further style customizations as required.
