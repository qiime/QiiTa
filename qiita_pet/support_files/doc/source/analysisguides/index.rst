Analysis Guides
===============


Qiita now uses `QIIME2 <http://qiime2.org>`__ plugins for analysis.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Thanks to this, we've got new layout of the analysis panel and the following new features:

* `alpha diversity <https://docs.qiime2.org/2017.6/plugins/available/diversity/alpha/>`__ (including statistics calculations; example `here <https://view.qiime2.org/visualization/?type=html&src=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.qiime2.org%2F2017.6%2Fdata%2Ftutorials%2Fmoving-pictures%2Fcore-metrics-results%2Ffaith-pd-group-significance.qzv>`__)  
* `beta diversity <https://docs.qiime2.org/2017.6/plugins/available/diversity/beta/>`__ (including stats)
* principal coordinate analysis (`PCoA <https://docs.qiime2.org/2017.6/plugins/available/diversity/pcoa/>`__), including ordination results and EMPeror plots (example `here <https://view.qiime2.org/visualization/?type=html&src=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.qiime2.org%2F2017.6%2Fdata%2Ftutorials%2Fmoving-pictures%2Fcore-metrics-results%2Funweighted-unifrac-emperor.qzv>`__)
* `rarefaction <https://docs.qiime2.org/2017.6/plugins/available/feature-table/rarefy/>`__
* `filter samples <https://docs.qiime2.org/2017.6/plugins/available/feature-table/filter_samples/>`__
* `taxa summary <https://docs.qiime2.org/2017.6/plugins/available/taxa/barplot/>`__ (example `here <https://view.qiime2.org/visualization/?type=html&src=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.qiime2.org%2F2017.6%2Fdata%2Ftutorials%2Fmoving-pictures%2Ftaxa-bar-plots.qzv>`__)


Analysis workflow
-----------------

Each analysis out of taxa summary, alpha diversity and beta diversity produces a QIIME2 visualization which can be browsed within Qiita, as well as downloadable result files.  
Filtering samples and rarefaction produce downloadable BIOM artifacts.

* creating new analysis
   Select Analysis -> Create new analysis from the main Qiita toolbar. From the list of your studies, select which studies and artifacts you want to add to your analysis.

   The analysis workflow now has a similar layout to sample processing. By selecting artifacts and commands from the drop-down menu below the workflow visualization, an entire analysis workflow can be created.

* filtering samples

   BIOM artifact can be filtered to include samples containing specific metadata categories, or minimum/maximum frequency or number of features.

* rarefying

   BIOM artifact can be rarefied to a desired sampling depth and results in a new rarefied BIOM artifact.

* taxa summary

   Takes BIOM artifact as input and returns an interactive stacked barchart which can be investigated on different taxonomic levels, as well as using metadata categories.

* alpha diversity

   Takes BIOM artifact as input. Produces a vector of alpha diversity results (text file) and downloadable interactive boxplots. Visualizations can be investigated using metadata categories and appropriate statistics are generated for all groups and pairwise.

* beta diversity

   Beta diversity analysis on a BIOM artifact can be performed using a variety of phylogenetic and non-phylogenetic distance metrics. Produces a distance matrix as output. 

* principal coordinate analysis

   Takes beta diversity distance matrix (result of beta diversity) and generates an interactive EMPeror plot.
