Prior to install, you must download and setup Postgres(9.3) and Mongodb(2.4.6). 
For Postgres, if operating on OS X, it is advised to use Postgres.app for 
simplicity.

Python level requirements can be found in requirements.txt. When creating a new
virtualenv, you should be able to just use the requirements file:

mkvirtualenv --no-site-packages -r requirements.txt monogoproto

Currently no cross script imports are happening, so paths do not need to be
manipulated
