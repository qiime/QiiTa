Qiita installation
==================

Qiita is pip installable, but depends on some non-python packages that must be installed first.

Install the non-python dependencies
-----------------------------------

* [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/download/) (minimum required version 9.3.0, we have tested most extensively with 9.3)
* [redis-server](http://redis.io) (we have tested most extensively with 2.8.17)

Install both of these packages according to the instructions on their websites.
You'll then need to ensure that the postgres binaries (for example, ``psql``)
are in your executable search path (``$PATH`` environment variable). For
example if you are using Postgres.app on OS X, you can do this by addint
the following line to your `.bash_profile`:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/9.3/bin/
```

Install Qiita and its python dependencies
-----------------------------------------

Then, you can use pip to install Qiita, which will also install its python dependencies.

```bash
pip install numpy
pip install https://github.com/biocore/mustached-octo-ironman/archive/master.zip --no-deps
pip install qiita-spots
```

Install Qiita development version and its python dependencies
-------------------------------------------------------------

You can also use pip to install the development version of Qiita:

```bash
pip install numpy
pip install https://github.com/biocore/mustached-octo-ironman/archive/master.zip --no-deps
```

Clone the git repository with the development version of Qiita:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/biocore/qiita.git
```

Install Qiita:
```bash
cd qiita
pip install .
```

You will also need to install the target gene plugin for Qiita to be fully functional.
However, the plugin is already included in the repository so to install it simply execute:
```bash
cd qiita_plugins/target_gene
pip install .
```

Qiita configuration
===================
After these commands are executed, you will need to:
1. Download a [sample Qiita configuration file](https://github.com/biocore/qiita/blob/master/qiita_core/support_files/config_test.cfg).

  ```bash
  cd
  curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biocore/qiita/master/qiita_core/support_files/config_test.cfg
  ```

2. Set your `QIITA_CONFIG_FP` environment variable to point to that file:

  ```bash
  echo "export QIITA_CONFIG_FP=$HOME/config_test.cfg" >> ~/.bashrc
  echo "export MOI_CONFIG_FP=$QIITA_CONFIG_FP" >> ~/.bashrc
  source ~/.bashrc
  ```

3. Start a test environment:

  ```bash
  qiita-env make --no-load-ontologies
  ```

4. Start the redis server:
  ```bash
  redis-server
  ```

5. Start the IPython cluster:

  ```bash
  qiita-env start_cluster qiita-general && sleep 30
  ```

6. Build the documentation (you may need to add `sudo` depending on your
   privileges and the installation location:

  ```bash
  qiita pet webserver
  ```

7. Start the server:

    ```bash
    qiita pet webserver start
    ```

If all the above commands executed correctly, you should be able to go to http://localhost:21174 in your browser, to login use `test@foo.bar` and `password` as the credentials. (In the future, we will have a *single user mode* that will allow you to use a local Qiita server without logging in. You can track progress on this on issue [#920](https://github.com/biocore/qiita/issues/920).)

## Installation issues on Ubuntu 14.04

### `fe_sendauth: no password supplied`

If you get a traceback similar to this one when starting up Qiita
```python
File "/home/jorge/code/qiita/scripts/qiita-env", line 71, in make
  make_environment(load_ontologies, download_reference, add_demo_user)
File "/home/jorge/code/qiita/qiita_db/environment_manager.py", line 180, in make_environment
  admin_conn = SQLConnectionHandler(admin='admin_without_database')
File "/home/jorge/code/qiita/qiita_db/sql_connection.py", line 120, in __init__
  self._open_connection()
File "/home/jorge/code/qiita/qiita_db/sql_connection.py", line 155, in _open_connection
  raise RuntimeError("Cannot connect to database: %s" % str(e))
RuntimeError: Cannot connect to database: fe_sendauth: no password supplied
```
it can be solved by setting a password for the database (replace `postgres` with the actual name of the database qiita is configured to use):
```
$ psql postgres
ALTER USER postgres PASSWORD 'supersecurepassword';
\q
```

It might be necessary to restart postgresql: `sudo service postgresql restart`.

Furthermore, the `pg_hba.conf` file can be modified to change authentication type for local users to trust (rather than, e.g., md5) but we haven't tested this solution.

## Troubleshooting installation on non-Ubuntu operating systems

### xcode

If running on OS X you should make sure that the Xcode and the Xcode command line tools are installed.

### postgres

If you are using Postgres.app on OSX, a database user will be created with your system username. If you want to use this user account, change the `USER` and `ADMIN_USER` settings to your username under the `[postgres]` section of your Qiita config file.

## Troubleshooting installation issues with Python

As a general rule of thumb you will want to have an updated version of Python
2.7 and an updated version of pip (`pip install -U pip` will do the trick).

H5PY is known to cause a few problems, however their [installation
instructions](http://docs.h5py.org/en/latest/build.html) are a great resource
to troubleshoot your system in case any of the steps above fail.

## Troubleshooting installation issues with matplotlib

In the event that you get `_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable` error while trying to generate figures that rely on matplotlib, you should create a matplotlib rc file. This configuration file should have `backend : agg`. For more information you should visit the [matplotlib configuration](http://matplotlib.org/users/customizing.html) and [troubleshooting](http://matplotlib.org/faq/troubleshooting_faq.html#locating-matplotlib-config-dir) page.
