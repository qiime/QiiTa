Install
-------

Once you have [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/download/) and [redis](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/redis/) installed (follow the instruction on their web site), simply run these commands to install qiita and configure the demo environment, replacing $QIITA_DIR for the path where qiita is installed
(note that if you are not using Ubuntu you might need to follow the instructions in the next section).

```bash
pip install numpy
pip install cogent burrito qcli emperor pyzmq
pip install https://github.com/biocore/qiime/archive/master.zip --no-deps
pip install https://github.com/biocore/mustached-octo-ironman/archive/master.zip --no-deps
pip install qiita-spots
```

After these commands are executed, you will need (1) download a [sample Qiita configuration file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biocore/qiita/master/qiita_core/support_files/config_test.txt), this file is included in the `pip` installation, (2) set the `QIITA_CONFIG_FP` environment variable and (3) proceed to initialize your environment:

```bash
# (1) use curl -O if using OS X
wget https://github.com/biocore/qiita/blob/a0628e54aef85b1a064d40d57ca981aaf082a120/qiita_core/support_files/config_test.txt
# (2) set the enviroment variable in your .bashrc
echo "export QIITA_CONFIG_FP=config_test.txt" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export MOI_CONFIG_FP=$QIITA_CONFIG_FP" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
# (3) start a test environment
qiita_env make --no-load-ontologies
```

Finally you need to start the server:

```bash
# IPython takes a while to get initialized so wait 30 seconds
qiita_env start_cluster demo test reserved && sleep 30
qiita webserver start

```

If all the above commands executed correctly, you should be able to go to http://localhost:8888 in your browser, to login use `demo@microbio.me` and `password` as the credentials.


## If using other operating systems that are not Ubuntu

You will need to add the postgres user to the database. In order to do this, run:

```bash
createuser -s postgres -d
```

If you receive the following error, you can ignore this step and continue with the qiita installation:
```bash
createuser: creation of new role failed: ERROR:  role "postgres" already exists
```
