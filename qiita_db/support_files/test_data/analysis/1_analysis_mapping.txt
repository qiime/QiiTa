1.SKM4.640180	TCGACCAAACAC	GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA	ANL	EMP	ANL	micro biome of soil and rhizosphere of cannabis plants from CA	Cannabis Soil Microbiome	MiSeq	Illumina MiSeq	This analysis was done as in Caporaso et al 2011 Genome research. The PCR primers (F515/R806) were developed against the V4 region of the 16S rRNA (both bacteria and archaea), which we determined would yield optimal community clustering with reads of this length using a procedure similar to that of ref. 15. [For reference, this primer pair amplifies the region 533_786 in the Escherichia coli strain 83972 sequence (greengenes accession no. prokMSA_id:470367).] The reverse PCR primer is barcoded with a 12-base error-correcting Golay code to facilitate multiplexing of up to 1,500 samples per lane, and both PCR primers contain sequencer adapter regions.
