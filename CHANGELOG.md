# Qiita changelog


Qiita 0.1.0-dev (changes since Qiita 0.1.0 go here)
---------------------------------------------------

* Creating an empty RawData is no longer needed in order to add a PrepTemplate.
Now, the PrepTemplate is required in order to add a RawData to a study. This is
the normal flow of a study, as the PrepTemplate information is usually
available before the RawData information is available.
* A user can upload a QIIME mapping file instead of a SampleTemplate. The
system will create a SampleTemplate and a PrepTemplate from the information
present in the QIIME mapping file. The QIIME required columns for this
functionality to work are 'BarcodeSequence', 'LinkerPrimerSequence' and
'Description'. For more information about QIIME mapping files, visit
http://qiime.org/documentation/file_formats.html#mapping-file-overview.
* The command line interface has been reorganized:
 * `qiita_env` has been renamed `qiita-env`
 * `qiita_test_install` has been renamed `qiita-test-install`
 * `qiita ebi` has been moved to `qiita ware ebi`
 * `qiita log` has been moved to `qiita maintenance log`
 * A new `qiita pet` command subgroup has been created
 * `qiita webserver` has been moved to `qiita pet webserver`
* Cluster names now use dashes instead of underscores (e.g., `qiita_general` is now `qiita-general`)
* `qiita-general` is now used as a default argument to `qiita-env start_cluster` and `qiita-env stop_cluster` if no cluster name is specified
* Qiita now allows to process already demultiplexed data without any technical (barcode and primer) section of the read.  

Version 0.1.0 (2015-04-30)
