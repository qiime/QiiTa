# Qiita changelog

Version 0.2.0-dev (Changes since version 0.2.0 go here)
-------------------------------------------------------

* Users can now change values and add samples and/or columns to sample and prep templates using the <kbd>Update</kbd> button (see the prep template and sample template tabs).

Version 0.2.0 (2015-08-25)
--------------------------

* Creating an empty RawData is no longer needed in order to add a PrepTemplate.
Now, the PrepTemplate is required in order to add a RawData to a study. This is
the normal flow of a study, as the PrepTemplate information is usually
available before the RawData information is available.
* A user can upload a QIIME mapping file instead of a SampleTemplate. The
system will create a SampleTemplate and a PrepTemplate from the information
present in the QIIME mapping file. The QIIME required columns for this
functionality to work are 'BarcodeSequence', 'LinkerPrimerSequence' and
'Description'. For more information about QIIME mapping files, visit
http://qiime.org/documentation/file_formats.html#mapping-file-overview.
* The command line interface has been reorganized:
 * `qiita_env` has been renamed `qiita-env`
 * `qiita_test_install` has been renamed `qiita-test-install`
 * `qiita ebi` has been moved to `qiita ware ebi`
 * `qiita log` has been moved to `qiita maintenance log`
 * A new `qiita pet` command subgroup has been created
 * `qiita webserver` has been moved to `qiita pet webserver`
* Cluster names now use dashes instead of underscores (e.g., `qiita_general` is now `qiita-general`)
* `qiita-general` is now used as a default argument to `qiita-env start_cluster` and `qiita-env stop_cluster` if no cluster name is specified
* Qiita now now allows for processing of already demultiplexed data without any technical (barcode and primer) section of the read.
* Qiita now includes full portal support, limiting study and analysis access at below the qiita_db level. This allows one database to act as if subsets of studies/analyses are their own specific interface. Commands added for portals creation and maintenance, under `qiita db portal ...` and `qiita-env`. Portal specific web user interface support has also been added; each portal is fully CSS customizable.
* 403 errors are now not logged in the logging table
* Qiita will execute all DB interactions in transactions. The queue code was moved and improved from SQLConnectionHandler to a new Transaction object. The system implements the singleton pattern. That is, there is only a single transaction in the system, represented by the variable `TRN`, and all DB interactions go through it.

Version 0.1.0 (2015-04-30)
--------------------------

Initial alpha release.
